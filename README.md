# Apex Legends Stats Tracker
This is a web application allowing to track the stats of a player according to different parameters. In order to make this possible, I used an API from the site https://tracker.gg/ and I built a backend to allow the user to receive the desired information. I used React for the front-end and Express/Node.js for the backend.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Crim-oo/ApexTracker.git
    ```

2. Set up the `client/server`

    Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm i 
    ```
     ```bash
    cd client/ && npm i 
    ```
    
    Set the variables in the `config.env` file:

    ```bash
    TRAKCER_API_KEY = Your Api Key here. Check out https://tracker.gg/developers for more informations.
    ```
    
3. Run the `application`
    
    Enter this command on the root of the project.
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```
